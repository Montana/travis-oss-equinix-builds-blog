In October 2019, Travis CI, ARM and Equinix Metal (previously called Packet) partnered to enable cloud CI/CD builds on previously unavailable CPU architecture targets, starting with Armv8. Infrastructure sponsored by ARM and set up thanks to the effort of Canonical LXD, Equinix and Travis CI teams was employed to run fast-starting, LXD container based build jobs over arm64. In the meantime a lot happened and it became apparent that faster Armv8 CPUs are needed.

Well to answer your question, here they are. Just add this in your `.travis.yml` file:

```yaml
os: linux
arch: arm64
```

That will now tell Travis to use the super fast new generation of `arm64` CPU based servers, deployed by Equinix for Travis CI. This is is free to use for OSS (build minute costs zero credits if you run a build over your open source repository) as a part of our [Partner Queue Solution](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/billing-overview/#partner-queue-solution). This infrastructure is not available for builds over private/proprietary source code.

## What is it and the benefit

The infrastructure upgrade allows Armv8 builds in LXD containers to spin up much faster. The performance improvement proved impressive, as Montana Mendy found out after taking the new environment for a test drive.

## Conclusion

Right now it actually doesnâ€™t matter which one of [Arm infrastructures available at Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-cpu-architectures/#multi-cpu-availaibility) you use: all are powered by modern, performant CPUs. Enjoy faster build times over Armv8 as well, we are sorry to make your coffee and tea breaks shorter!

## Where to find out more

You can find out more about the new Arm on AWS Graviton2 integration by reading about the [Travis CI build environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/) and building on [multi-CPU architectures](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-cpu-architectures). Be sure to leave your feedback and join the discussion over at the [community forum](https://travis-ci.community/c/integrations/aws-graviton2/102).
